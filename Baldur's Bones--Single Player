    1. With Baldur's Bones in hand, you’ll roll three dice of six. The
gamesmaster, Garl Glitterbeard, does the same, and the game has begun.\n
    2. Should you feel brave, rolls are made again until you’re satisfied, and 
your number is then set in stone.\n
    3. If your total count ever exceeds eighteen, fate has abandoned you, 
and your game is lost.\n
    4. If, in your bravery and wisdom both, your number is closest to eighteen, 
you’ve outplayed the gamesmaster, and have won Baldur’s Bones. """
